<h2>Instructions for option entry </h2>
<ol>
	<li> The candidates have to enter their choices in the decreasing order of their priority.</li>
	<li> That is, they should enter their first choice as the most preferred choice and so on.</li>
	<li> A candidate can enter any number of preferences he/she wants to</li>
	<li> The allocation of seat is dependent on the number of seats available in the college for that branch</li>
	<li> The allocation process starts by giving the highest scored candidate the first preference and so on</li>
	<li> However, once the options are submitted you cannot change your preferences as there is only one round of allocation</li>
	<li> So make sure that you give your order of preferences appropriately</li>

</ol>

<h2>Important note:</h2>
<p> a seat will only be allocated if you have taken the test. In case you have enterred your choices of preferences but not taken
	the test, then no seat shall be allocated even if there is availablility of seats</p>
	<p> However, there is no rule that you should take your test first and then enter your choices. You can first enter your choices and
		then take the test as well</p>
